#This command will let you know which Linux OS you are using 
cat /etc/os-release  

#First, install the necessary packages
sudo dnf install realmd sssd adcli krb5-workstation samba-common-tools oddjob oddjob-mkhomedir 

#Use the realm command to discover the domain you want to join
realm discover example.com 

#uUse the realm command to join the domain. You will need the credentials of a user who has permission to join computers to the domain
sudo realm join --user=Administrator example.com 
 
#After joining the domain, configure SSSD for authentication
sudo nano /etc/sssd/sssd.conf 


#Add the following configuration (modify example.com to match your domain):

[sssd]
services = nss, pam
config_file_version = 2
domains = example.com

[domain/example.com]
id_provider = ad
access_provider = ad

#Set the correct permissions for the sssd.conf file:
sudo chmod 600 /etc/sssd/sssd.conf


#Start the SSSD service and enable it to start on boot
sudo systemctl start sssd
sudo systemctl enable sssd

#Ensure that the PAM and NSS systems are configured to use SSSD for authentication:
sudo authconfig --enablesssd --enablesssdauth --enablemkhomedir --update

#Verify that the machine has successfully joined the domain and that you can authenticate against it:
id your-domain-user@example.com

#Add a line like this (replace example.com with your domain and domain-users with the appropriate group):
%domain-users@example.com ALL=(ALL) ALL
